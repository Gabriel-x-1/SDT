## Exercise 1: Object Pool + Singleton âœ…

**Location:** `src/lab3/`

**Files:**
- `DBConnection.java` - Mock database connection with unique ID
- `DBConnectionPool.java` - Singleton Object Pool managing connections and enforcing max 5 limit
- `ConnectionObserver.java` - Observer interface
- `LoggerObserver.java` - Logs acquire/release events
- `Main.java` - 10 concurrent clients test

**Features Implemented:**
- âœ… Object Pool pattern with acquire/release
- âœ… Singleton pattern (DBConnectionPool itself)
- âœ… Max 5 connections enforced directly in pool
- âœ… Thread-safe concurrent access with wait/notify
- âœ… Observer pattern for logging
- âœ… Proper output: "Connection X was acquired/released by client Y"
- âœ… Tested with 10 concurrent clients
- âœ… No prototype pattern (connections created directly)

**Test Results:**
```
Connection 1 was acquired by client 1
Connection 2 was acquired by client 2
...
All clients finished. Created connections: 5 (max 5)
```

## Exercise 2: Prototype Pattern âœ…

**Location:** `ex2/`

**Files:**
- `Character.java` - RPG character with clone() method
- `CharacterRegistry.java` - Singleton prototype library
- `CharacterObserver.java` - Observer interface
- `LoggerObserver.java` - Logs character modifications
- `CharacterPool.java` - Object pool for blank characters
- `Main.java` - Interactive console application

**Features Implemented:**
- âœ… Prototype pattern with clone() method
- âœ… No new classes for different characters
- âœ… CharacterRegistry with Warrior, Wizard, Rogue prototypes
- âœ… Interactive character creation and editing
- âœ… Attribute validation (3-20 range)
- âœ… Observer pattern for logging changes
- âœ… Complete character display with all stats

**Predefined Characters:**
- **Warrior**: STR 18, CON 16, DEX 12, INT 8, WIS 10, CHA 9
- **Wizard**: STR 8, CON 10, DEX 12, INT 18, WIS 14, CHA 11
- **Rogue**: STR 12, CON 12, DEX 18, INT 10, WIS 11, CHA 13

## Exercise 3: Observer Pattern âœ…

**Location:** `ex3/`

**Files:**
- `User.java` - User class (both Subject and Observer)
- `Main.java` - Social network simulation

**Features Implemented:**
- âœ… Observer pattern (users follow other users)
- âœ… Follow/unfollow mechanism
- âœ… Status posting with follower notifications
- âœ… Proper output: "UserX was notified that UserY posted..."
- âœ… Random status generation
- âœ… 5 users with predefined relationships
- âœ… Scheduled executor for random posts

**Test Network:**
- Alice (3 followers: Bob, Charlie, Diana)
- Bob (2 followers: Alice, Charlie)
- Charlie (3 followers: Alice, Bob, Eve)
- Diana (0 followers)
- Eve (2 followers: Diana, Bob)

**Sample Statuses:**
- "made omelette, looks delicious"
- "just finished a great book"
- "loving this sunny weather"
- ...and 7 more

## How to Run

### Interactive Menu (Recommended)
```bash
cd /Users/bilciurescugabriel/Desktop/SDT/lab3
./start.sh
```

Then select:
1. Exercise 1 - Object Pool demo
2. Exercise 2 - Character creator (interactive)
3. Exercise 3 - Social network simulation
4. Run all (skips interactive ex2)
5. Exit

### Direct Execution
```bash
# Run specific exercise
./start.sh 1    # Exercise 1
./start.sh 2    # Exercise 2 (interactive)
./start.sh 3    # Exercise 3

# Run all non-interactive
./start.sh --all
```

### Manual Compilation
```bash
javac -d out src/lab3/*.java ex2/*.java ex3/*.java
java -cp out lab3.Main       # Exercise 1
java -cp out ex2.Main        # Exercise 2
java -cp out ex3.Main        # Exercise 3
```

## Design Patterns Used

### Primary Patterns (Required)
1. **Object Pool** (Exercise 1): Reuse expensive resources
2. **Prototype** (Exercise 2): Clone objects without new classes
3. **Observer** (Exercise 3): Notification system

### Additional Patterns (Bonus)
4. **Singleton** (Exercise 1, 2): Pool and registry instances
5. **Observer** (Exercise 1, 2): Logging modifications

## Next Steps

1. **Review the implementations** in each exercise directory
2. **Run the start.sh script** to see all exercises in action
3. **Prepare for lab grading** - focus on Exercise 1 & 2
4. **Test modifications** - the code is well-structured for extensions
